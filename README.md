Overview of the Project

This program is a simple calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here's an overview:

Purpose:
The program allows users to:

Input two numbers.
Choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
View the result of the selected operation.

Key Features:

User Input Handling: Prompts the user for two numeric inputs.
Operation Selection: Provides a menu of four operations to choose from.

Error Handling:

Ensures valid numeric inputs.
Handles division by zero gracefully by displaying an error message.
Alerts the user if an invalid operation choice is made.
Output: Displays the result of the chosen arithmetic operation.

Flow:

The user is welcomed and asked to input two numbers.
A menu displays four options: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.
If the input is invalid, appropriate error messages guide the user.

Practical Applications:

This program serves as a foundational exercise in user interaction, input validation, and control flow in Python. It is simple yet demonstrates essential programming concepts like exception handling and conditional statements.
